## The Taking Cara Babies Flyby
We spent a few weeks learning how Taking Cara Babies does their work, and some of the pain points that was holding them back. You can watch an overview of the flyby process and read more below the video.

When we start an engagement with a client, we know nothing about their process. In this case, we do what we call a flyby. We dive into the process over six to eight weeks and try to diagram their process. This activity reveals our clients’ challenges and helps us focus on the top priorities. 

We utilize Miro (essentially a large whiteboard) to facilitate these sessions, aiming to articulate our client’s biggest challenges. We asked Taking Cara Babies to describe their process, and then we would listen and take notes. They provided a diagram that we used as a jumping-off point and then tried to expand on it. Over the course of a few meetings, we were able to document eight different software they were using, their strengths and weaknesses, and how these software communicated with one another.

Once we understood the types of software they were using and which ones were working, we expanded on their original diagram. We built a customer journey map that showed how a customer navigates from their website through their purchase funnel and to customer support if needed. 

This visualization helped us identify some gaps in the process and helped us determine where we would focus our efforts. We ended by creating a feature roadmap that aligned with the Taking Cara Babies vision, and we used that as our north star when building features for the next eight months. Watch this video to get a feel for the type of work we do on a flyby.
