This is a sneak peek into some work we're doing to support the Taking Cara Babies’ awesome blog team. They work hard to create resources for new parents, especially those who are trying to get some sleep.

Over the last few years, they’ve created over one hundred blog posts that cover everything you could want to know about sleep for infants all the way to toddlers. The challenge for the Taking Cara Babies blog team is managing all of those posts. They monitor traffic and conversion and try to optimize how the pages rank in Google Search. 

With limited resources, they have to be able to focus on pages that drive the most traffic and the most conversions.  I borrowed this nifty concept from Ryan Sleeper – it essentially divides data into four quadrants using averages. (I came up with the names, though.) 

- Mystical Unicorns: These are the pages with above-average traffic and above-average purchases.
- Traffic Cows: These pages receive a lot of traffic but have below-average purchases.
- Return Gazelles: These pages have above-average purchases but not as much traffic.
- Lazy Lemurs: These are below average on both traffic and purchases.

Our main goal is to create a quick guide that helps the blog team focus on the top 30 pages, the "Mystical Unicorns." We want to make sure they continue to shine, maintain their search ranking, and keep performing well. If they seek opportunities to improve, they can consider the Traffic Cows or the Return Gazelles. 

For example, with the traffic cows, the pages must be valuable because so many people visit them, but they don’t do a strong job of pulling readers deeper into the funnel. Maybe there is an opportunity to give readers more engaging content or introduce other ways Taking Cara Babies could help? 

Or, if the blog team wants to focus on Return Gazelles, they might see if there are more ways they can drive traffic to those pages. Can they improve the keywords that are on the page or potentially add more internal links from other pages and drive traffic that way? 

As to the Lazy lemurs, I suggest ignoring them. Unless there’s a compelling reason to work on them, it usually makes more sense to invest in the pages that show promise. 

Ultimately, we wanted to create a tool that helps the blog team do their job better, which helps millions of new parents help their babies get 10-12 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night. And that’s a big deal.
