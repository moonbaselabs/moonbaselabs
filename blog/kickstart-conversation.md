Hey friends! ðŸ‘‹

About a month ago, I began interviewing nonprofit leaders to discuss how software impacts their work. After hearing from more than a dozen leaders, I'm seeing a few patterns:
* Software is frustrating. I heard lots of venting. ðŸ˜€
* Choosing software is overwhelming. So many choices!
* Building a tech-savvy nonprofit is hard.

It shouldnâ€™t be this way! I want to kickstart a conversation about ways nonprofits can use technology more effectively. 

But I need your help! I can bring the technical knowledge, but I need you to help me identify why so many nonprofits fall behind. Is it a lack of training? A lack of exposure to great software? Something in the water? 

**Why does technology seem to be doing more harm than good?**

Here are a few interventions Iâ€™m kicking the tires on:
* Zoom meetups to share stories about software experiences (positive and negative)
* A one-day summit to bring tech leaders and nonprofit leaders together to learn from one another
* In-depth training for nonprofit leaders to improve how they use software

What absolutely no one wanted (despite my frequent suggestions) was a newsletter about nonprofit tech. I hear you. No newsletters.

On **June 4th at 11 a.m. CST, I will host a 30-minute Zoom meeting** to discuss some of my findings and gather your suggestions on ways tech leaders like me can help. 

If you are interested, send me an email at ted@moonbaselabs.com, and Iâ€™ll add you to the calendar invite. If you canâ€™t attend but want to stay connected to this conversation, send me an email at ted@moonbaselabs.com, and Iâ€™ll keep you in the loop via something that is definitely not a newsletter.

Thank you so much for the wonderful work you do to improve our communities. 

Talk soon!

Ted
