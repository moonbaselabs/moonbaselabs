## We want to build a software prototype for one stellar nonprofit (for free.)

Sometimes, innovation needs a nudge. We want to jumpstart someone’s idea by giving a nonprofit a chance to build a proof of concept to share with their community. We hope that this prototype gains traction and builds momentum around your cause.

## Problems we could tackle
We are willing to work on problems for the people you serve or the people on your team.

#### Ideas for people you serve
- Convert a paper application process to a digital, mobile-friendly version
- Provide text alerts or email notifications to share when new resources are available
- Build visibility for grassroots leaders to create action in their communities

#### Ideas for people on your team
- Integrate your donor management system with your payment processors (like Stripe or Paypal)
- Effortlessly track your grant applications as they flow through the review process
- Demonstrate impact with critical metrics you share with directors and stakeholders through an automated dashboard 

## How it works
Our team will review applications throughout March and April and select a nonprofit candidate to begin the project with. We’ll start development in May. We’ll commit 100 hours of design and development work to building this prototype. (We usually charge $25,000 for this service.)
 
Our development process usually looks something like this:
- Day 1 **Kick-off meeting**
- Day 1 - Day 30 **Sketches and wireframes** 
- Day 30 - Day 60 **Development and feedback** 
- Day 60 - Day 90 **Demonstration and go live** 

Moonbase Labs will provide a free year of hosting, maintenance, and support for your application. ($2,500 value.)

## Who should apply 
Any nonprofit is eligible. Here’s what we are looking for:

**High-quality idea that has strong potential for traction**
No moonshots! We’re just trying to prove an idea. It doesn’t have to be sexy or newsworthy. Our best work often looks boring to outsiders. We’re content to know that the people who use it will experience how transformative it is. 

**A stable organization that can support custom software**
This prototype won’t be a finished product. We want to partner with a nonprofit that can carry it to the finish line. That could look like having an in-house development team (we build Laravel applications) or a willingness to get funding for additional development over the subsequent 12 to 24 months. ($50,000 to $100,000 would be a reasonable ballpark range.)

## Timeline:
- Submit your application by **April 22nd**
- Finalists will be notified by **April 24th**
- Finalist interviews will be held during the week of **April 29th**
- The winner will be announced on **May 2nd**

## What’s in it for us?
Why is Moonbase Labs doing this? Partly because we love to help nonprofits but mostly because we view this as marketing. We want to position Moonbase Labs as the premier tech partner for innovative nonprofits nationwide. Instead of attending conferences and networking events, we’d prefer to focus on what we do well and then tell people about it. We plan to use this campaign to promote the organization we work with and the technology we create to help them. In the worst-case scenario, we waste one hundred hours building great technology for a worthy cause. We’ll take that over a networking event any day. 

## Apply today
It takes less than five minutes.
