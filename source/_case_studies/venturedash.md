## The Vision

Since 2013, NetWork Kansas has organized over 150 youth entrepreneurship competitions throughout Kansas. Each year, their team coordinates hundreds of entrepreneurs, judges, mentors and teachers across dozens of these impactful events.

As the program grew year after year, the spreadsheets and off-the-shelf tools NetWork Kansas utilized to manage it struggled to keep up.

When NetWork Kansas reached out to Moonbase Labs, the primary objective was to build a tool that would improve the scalability and reach of their current program. After a few meetings, we helped identify an opportunity for them to use their subject matter expertise in this area to develop a brand new, nation-wide product.

With this bold vision as the compass, we set out to create a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, which would allow NetWork Kansas to manage a greater number of competitions from a single platform without adding new staff. Additionally, by licensing the software to other competitions nationally, **they would establish a new revenue stream that could sustain the program into the future.**

## The Results

Over the course of 8 months, we collaborated with the NetWork Kansas team to develop VentureDash – __“The best way to run a business competition.”__ VentureDash is an online entrepreneurship competition management system designed to streamline the facilitation of entrepreneurship fairs and business plan competitions held throughout the United States.

The Moonbase Labs team completed work across a variety of competencies to deliver the following for VentureDash:

 * Marketing website
 * Web application
 * Logo and cohesive brand elements
 * Payment processing
 * Customer support tools:
  * Support ticket management
  * Knowledge base and help center
  * Community

Completed in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the VentureDash platform could not have come at a better time for NetWork Kansas. This new product was a timely solution for communities in Kansas looking to take their annual competitions virtual.

“VentureDash has become a powerful platform for us to promote youth entrepreneurship on a national stage and it wouldn't be possible without our partnership with Moonbase Labs.“

In its first six months, 95 competitions were created on VentureDash with a total of over 1,100 participants across the country.

## The Takeaway
NetWork Kansas is no stranger to innovation; they have been iterating with data analytics processes for years now. VentureDash is a great web-based software addition to a deep line-up of technology tools.
