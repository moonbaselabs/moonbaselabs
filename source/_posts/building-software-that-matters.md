Moonbase Labs has never really had a “niche.” We are a team of  problem solvers, so naturally, we do our best to help everyone who walks through our doors. In January, we took time to reflect on the last few years and a pattern came to light: **We enjoy helping people who help people.**

We discussed our favorite projects and the partnerships we’ve created over the last few years. Todd Wiedemann with [Kansas MTSS](/case-studies/kerii/); Steve Radley and Erik Pedersen at [NetWork Kansas](/case-studies/venturedash/); Ed O’Malley and Julia Fabris McBride with the [Kansas Leadership Center](/case-studies/kansas-beats-the-virus/). What do all of these people have in common? They are innovative leaders of highly impactful nonprofits. More importantly, they are wildly talented individuals on a mission to do good. They are improving the lives of teachers, serving entrepreneurs, and inspiring the bold leaders of tomorrow. Those missions matter: they matter to our communities, and that matters to us.

We want to build software that matters.


We want to give nonprofits the tools that built Netflix and Amazon. We want good to scale. Empowered teachers, diverse entrepreneurs, stronger leaders: those missions are now our mission. We build software to empower the doers; our analytics tools create context for progress.

Our team wants to be the change we see in the world. It’s why Nic is on the board of [DevICT](https://devict.org) and why Ted co-founded a nonprofit, [Eight Oaks](https://www.8oaks.org). It’s why Christian contributes to [VoteLocal](https://votelocalks.org), an open source project that helps people vote. We care about our community. We want to help.
